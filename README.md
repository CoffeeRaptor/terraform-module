# AWS Infrastructure with Terraform

This repository contains Terraform code for managing various AWS infrastructure components, including EC2 instances, databases, S3 buckets, Auto Scaling Groups (ASG), and more. The goal is to automate the deployment and configuration of essential AWS services to create a scalable and reliable cloud environment.

## About This Project

The code in this repository draws inspiration from the book *Terraform: Up & Running (3rd Edition)* by Yevgeniy Brikman. The book provides practical examples of infrastructure as code (IaC) principles, and this repository adapts those concepts to build AWS infrastructure using Terraform. ["Terraform Up & Running"] (https://www.terraformupandrunning.com/) by [Yevgeniy Brikman](https://github.com/brikis98). 

### Components Included

The Terraform configurations in this repository help set up:

- **EC2 Instances**: Virtual servers to host applications.
- **Databases**: Managed database services (e.g., RDS) for data storage.
- **S3 Buckets**: Storage for files, backups, and static content.
- **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)**: Ensures that EC2 instances scale up or down based on demand.
- **And More**: Additional AWS services will be added to enhance functionality and resilience.
